# kraken_utils

Utility functions for kraken descriptors from paper: [A Comprehensive Discovery Platform for Organophosphorus Ligands for Catalysis](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c09718)

These python functions allow the search and extraction of molecular and conformer-specific descriptors present in the Kraken database, as well as easy integration with downstream modeling tasks.
